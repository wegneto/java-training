/*
You are given a series of stock prices for some unspecified time period. At each point in time you could either buy one piece of stock at the given price, or sell the stock you have bought at that price. Your goal is to write a method that calculates the maximum possible profit you could have if you buy once and sell once.

Example:
input: 5, 3, 9, 2, 7, 10, 1, 6
-> maximum potential profit 8: (10 - 2)

You can observe the whole sequence.
